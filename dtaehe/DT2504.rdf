Title: A Long-Term Perspective of the Resource Curse Hypothesis
Abstract: The resource curse hypothesis (RCH) has become one of the main lines of research in development economics. Based on a potential negative correlation between economic growth and the abundance (dependence) of natural resources, the RCH has generated thousands of articles and books. Most of these works used the time span of the years between 1970 and the present. Economic history has taken the hypothesis seriously, and in recent years, several studies with a long-term perspective have tested contemporary findings with mixed results. An analysis using longer time intervals has allowed us to have a better perspective of the relations between the abundance and dependence of natural resources on economic development. This work approaches this non-lineal relation using the most relevant economic history research on the topic. Moreover, a research agenda is suggested to enhance the input that Economic History could give to policy makers.
